                <img src="../../images/site_media/phirephlies_logo_small.jpg" width="175" height="75" align="right" />By Rudyard Kipling</h2>
            <p>The Phoenix Players Phire Phlies will be presenting Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, a delightful play based on a number of tales by the author of The Jungle Book.</p>
            <p>Elsie Kipling is staying with her aunt when she receives a package from South Africa. In the package is a book containing a number of Elsie's favorite stories written by her father who is traveling in "far away lands." The tales include such delightful stories as...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"How the Camel Got His Hump,"</li>
                <li>"How the Kangaroo Learned to Jump,"</li>
                <li>"How the Armadillo Came to Be," and</li>
                <li>"How the Elephant Got His Trunk."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Elsie decides it would be fun to act them out with the help of friends who are visiting.</p>
            <p>The children, using only their imaginations and household items, transform themselves into all sorts of animals and exotic characters such as the Djinn and the Parsee as they perform the stories. They learn a great deal about different lands and creatures but are surprised to find out that Elsie does not want them to perform one of the stories. In helping her to reveal why, everyone learns about the need for friends to help you through difficult times.</p>

            <p>The play is a perfect introduction to live theatre for young children, but is also a delightful presentation for older children and adults. Written with a great deal of humor and whimsy, the production is being performed by The Phoenix Players youth acting ensemble, a group of children aged 7-15 who are members of the Phoenix Players Acting Academy. The Academy uniquely provides professional level acting training to a select group of young performers.</p>

            <p>The show will be presented at The Phoenix Players Theatre in the Historic Green Oak Township Hall, 10789 Silver Lake Road, approximately 2 miles east of US 23.
