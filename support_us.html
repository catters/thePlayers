                                    <h2>Together with Green Oak Township Historical Society</h2>
                                    <p>There is only one way for a theatre company to expand and thrive to its
                                        best ability and that is to have a viable venue for its productions. In
                                        addition, the township hall will be used to its best advantage when local
                                        residents can continue to enjoy the aesthetics and sense of history on
                                        a continuing basis.</p>
                                    <p>For this reason, the Phoenix Players and The Green Oak Historical Society
                                        feel that a joint venture to bring live theatre performances to the 1856
                                        Green Oak Township Hall will be the best for our needs.</p>
                                    <p>The historic township hall is the most feasible local venue for our productions,
                                        workshops, camps, and rehearsals. The schools have a few stages available,
                                        but the cost is prohibitive, and the spaces are not available for any extended
                                        period of time. Performing arts centers in the local area charge far more
                                        than any non-profit can afford and buying our own space without an extensive
                                        treasury is impossible.</p>
                                    <p>While the space is small, allowing for an audience of about 40 people
                                        and a 16x20 foot stage, we have the innovative ability to work around these
                                        obstacles. Sets will be minimal, with the focus being on the acting, and
                                        with the ability to do more performances of each play, we can still accommodate
                                        all of the people who enjoy our productions. As the Historical Society
                                        is a non-profit, we have agreed to equitably share the profits of the Phoenix
                                        Players events, which will allow The Society to use their portion to do
                                        further renovations on this important local historic site.</p>
                                    <p>Once we are done with our preliminary work on the building, we will be
                                        able not only to have our own space, but The Historical Society will be
                                        able to offer it to other local non-profit groups, such as musical groups,
                                        for their performances. This will fill a great need for such venues in
                                        the area and allow for even more cultural events to be provided to the
                                        community. Additionally, the increased revenue will help to fund our and
                                        the Historic Society&rsquo;s plans for the future.</p>
                                    <p>We hope you share our vision for the future of the cultural experiences
                                        in western Oakland and eastern Livingston counties. We think that we have
                                        a great deal to offer and that our goals are reasonable and very reachable.
                                        The experiences we offer, especially to children, give them life-long memories
                                        and skills.</p>
                                    <p>Our plans allow for a double donation&mdash;helping the arts community
                                        and the cause of historic preservation at the same time. Few organizations
                                        can make that claim. Donations to our group are tax deductible and will
                                        give your organization or business a visible expression of your support
                                        of the local community.</p>
