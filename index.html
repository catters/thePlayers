                                    <h1>Taming Shakespeare</h1>
                                    <h2>For young people ages 7-16</h2>
                                    <h3>August 12 &amp; 14 from 1-3pm</h3>
                                    <p>For the third year, The Phoenix Players is continuing its annual Shakespeare Lite Series with a production of Taming Shakespeare. The Shakespeare Lite series is designed to make Shakespeare fun and accessible to children and adults who thinks that Shakespeare is boring and can't be understood. It is also fun for those who already know and enjoy Shakespeare.</p>
                                    <p>Taming Shakespeare will be presented on Fridays October 10th and 17th at 7:30 p.m., Saturdays October 11th and 18th a 7:00 p.m., and Sundays, October 12 &amp; 19th at 2:00 p.m. The production will be held in The Phoenix Players Theatre in the Historic Green Oak Township Hall, 10789 Silver Lake Road. Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors and students, and $8 for children (13 and under).</p>
                                    <p>The show, which includes <a href="shows_and_events/2013-2014/taming-shakespeare.html">two one act plays</a> separated by an intermission is being presented by the Players Phire Phlies Youth Acting troupe. Comprised of children ages 8-15, the Phire Phlies study acting and Shakespeare in special workshops before being in the play. Audiences are amazed at how these young people can easily do Shakespeare and make it understandable.  One playgoer last fall said "I never thought I could understand Shakespeare, but I do now and I loved your production of Hamlet.".</p>
                                    <p>The first play of the two will be <em>Hello Shakespeare</em>, a hilarious introduction to Shakespeare's work complete with pies in the face and bonks on the head. The second play <em>When Shakespeare's Ladies Meet</em> has been adapted especially for young people by Anne Levy of Brighton and Leanne Young of South Lyon. This play finds many of Shakespeare's heroines, including Ophelia, Desdemona, Portia, and Cleopatra gathering together at Juliet's house in Verona to try and convince her that love in a Shakespeare play is filled with trouble. The young Juliet, though, is unconvinced, and finally leaves to marry her Romeo, sure that all will turn out ok. Intertwining original Shakespeare lines with humor, modern language, and modern ideas, the play is sure to delight even those who have never read a single Shakespeare play.</p>
                                    <p>Anyone who would like to see a sneak preview of the play is invited to "A Peek Behind the Curtain" sponsored by the South Lyon Cultural Commission on Sunday, October 5 at 3 p.m. at McHattie Park.</p>
