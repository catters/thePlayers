                                    <p>&quot;I have been with the Phoenix Players as a Phire Phlie for seven
                                        years. It is one of the most rewarding and incredible experiences and I
                                        cannot even begin to express in words how grateful I am for this group.</p>
                                    <p>I have gotten so much from the Phoenix Players. Being a Phire Phlie has
                                        improved my public speaking skills and my confidence. It has taught me
                                        to open up and step out of the bounds of my comfort zone. I have learned
                                        how to work on and off of the stage. Acting has become my hobby, my interest,
                                        and my passion. It is an activity that I enjoy more than anything else
                                        in the world. I have been introduced to an amazing theatre family. I am
                                        so extremely proud to say that I am a Phire Phlie.</p>
                                    <p>A Phire Phlie has many defining characteristics. We are respectful to
                                        everyone in the cast and crew, as they are our friends and our family.
                                        We are responsible and follow directions. We try new things, look out for
                                        each other, work hard, and stay positive. Phire Phlies are capable of anything
                                        they set their minds to.</p>
                                    <p>The Phoenix Players has, very simply, changed my life. I do not know where
                                        I would be right now if I had not gone to that workshop all those years
                                        ago. I have met fantastic people, put on amazing shows, and learned valuable
                                        lessons. I am, and always will be, a Phoenix Players Phire Phlie.&quot;</p>
